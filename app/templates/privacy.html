    <p>
        Dotabank are comitted to respecting the privacy of our visitors and others whose data we are able to access.
        This page explains what information we collect, how we use that information, and what measures we take to
        safeguard potentially identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies / Steam OpenID</h3>
    <ul class="list-unstyled text-muted">
        <li><strong>Cookies</strong> - Small snippets of data generated by a web server that are stored within visitors'
            web browsers, and sent back to the web server on subsequent requests to a website.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam OpenID</strong> - A method of logging in to a website using a Steam account, without exposing
            sensitive data (usernames, passwords, e-mail addresses) to those websites.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We use cookies in order to provide session-based interactivity between the Dotabank website and you, which makes
        Dotabank user accounts possible; we use Steam OpenID as the authentication provider for our user accounts.
    </p>

    <h3>Replays</h3>
    <ul class="list-unstyled text-muted">
        <li><strong>Replay</strong> - A recording of a Dota 2 match, containing all in-game actions and information to
            identify Steam accounts for the matches' participants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Replays are the bread and butter of our operation at Dotabank; the site's functionality is centered around being
        a persistant store for Dota 2 replays. We download and store replays on Amazon S3, and we require visitors pass
        a human-verification process (Recaptcha) before we allow them to download a replay.

        Replay files do list the Steam account ids of match participants, but we choose not to make that information
        directly available through us as those Steam users had not consented to us doing so.
    </p>

    <h3>Server logs</h3>
    <ul class="list-unstyled text-muted">
        <li><strong>Server</strong> - A computer that exists to provide a service to other computers through a network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For every request our web servers recieve from you they store within their logs: Your IP address, your referrer
        (the url you were at prior to making the request), and your browser and operating system.  This data is used for
        diagnostic and analytical purposes (see also
        <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html">Google Analytics' privacy overview</a>).
