        <strong>GC Errors</strong> - Recent Dota 2 updates have caused match detail requests to time out for all game clients, as a result Dotabank
        cannot currently access the information required to download and archive replays.  We will go through and attempt to re-archive any failed
        matches once the game has been fixed.
